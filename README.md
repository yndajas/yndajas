# 👋🏻 Hello

I'm Ynda ([they/them](https://name.pn/ynda-jas#pronouns); 🔊 [in-duh](https://name.pn/ynda-jas#pronunciation)), a software engineer experienced in Ruby (inc. Rails) and JavaScript-based programming (inc. TypeScript, Vue, and React) with a background in education, research, and community-building.

I currently work at dxw, where I mostly build public sector websites, but I also dabble in internal work. The latter varies from shell scripting to user scripting to recruitment to solidarity building ✊🏻 to accessibility advocacy to building an online multiplayer quiz game.

The reason I became a software engineer was to make a difference in a job that combines problem solving, creativity, and a continuous journey of learning and discovery.

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yndajas), [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@YndaJas), and various other social networks (@yndajas). You might be able to reach me by email, but don't bank on it: [yndajas@gmail.com](mailto:yndajas@gmail.com)

## 👩🏻‍💻 Projects

I removed this section because it was largely out of date, but you can check it out in its not-up-to-date state in [a dedicated file](https://github.com/yndajas/yndajas/blob/main/projects.md).

[My CV](YJ_CV_220112.pdf) is likewise very much out of date - my LinkedIn profile is better maintained, but doesn't contain much project detail.

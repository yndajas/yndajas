# üëãüèª Hello

I'm Ynda ([they/them](https://name.pn/ynda-jas#pronouns); üîä
[in-duh](https://name.pn/ynda-jas#pronunciation)), a software engineer
experienced in Ruby (inc. Rails) and JavaScript-based programming (inc.
TypeScript, Vue, and React) with a background in education, research, and
community-building.

I currently work at dxw, where I mostly build digital public services, but I
also dabble in internal work. The latter varies from shell scripting to user
scripting to recruitment to solidarity building ‚úäüèª to accessibility advocacy to
building an online multiplayer quiz game.

The reason I became a software engineer was to make a difference in a job that
combines problem solving, creativity, and a continuous journey of learning and
discovery.

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yndajas),
<a href="https://tech.lgbt/@YndaJas" rel="me nofollow">Mastodon</a>, and some
other social networks (@yndajas). You might be able to reach me by email, but
don't bank on it: [yndajas@gmail.com](mailto:yndajas@gmail.com). And I have a
lightweight forever-in-progress
[personal site](https://yndajas.github.io/simple-website).

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Projects

In lieu of a hard-to-maintain detailed projects section, below are links to a
select few repositories to which I've made substantial contributions.

I don't have a well-maintained CV either, but my LinkedIn profile includes a
fairly detailed history of CV-like facts, sans details on specific projects.

You can also:

- browse past personal/non-client work by using a handy filter to view all of
  [my non-archived original ('source' or non-forked) repositories](https://github.com/yndajas?tab=repositories&q=&type=source).
  This filters out several hundred archived forked repositories, most of which
  are just study materials and exercises

## Language stats

Below is a visualisation of time spent working in different languages since
early 2021. Linked via the image is a version that should be more screen reader
friendly, though navigating to the SVG's text content with a keyboard might be a
challenge.

The data are taken from WakaTime, which tracks and categorises the time spent
editing code. I believe I've been using it pretty consistently with my main
editor since early 2021. You can also check out
[my WakaTime profile](https://wakatime.com/@yndajas) for an alternative look at
the data.

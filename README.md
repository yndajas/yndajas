# üëãüèª Hello

I'm Ynda ([they/them](https://name.pn/ynda-jas#pronouns); üîä [in-duh](https://name.pn/ynda-jas#pronunciation)), a software engineer experienced in Ruby (inc. Rails) and JavaScript-based programming (inc. TypeScript, Vue, and React) with a background in education, research, and community-building.

I currently work at dxw, where I mostly build digital public services, but I also dabble in internal work. The latter varies from shell scripting to user scripting to recruitment to solidarity building ‚úäüèª to accessibility advocacy to building an online multiplayer quiz game.

The reason I became a software engineer was to make a difference in a job that combines problem solving, creativity, and a continuous journey of learning and discovery.

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yndajas), <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@YndaJas" rel="me nofollow">Mastodon</a>, and some other social networks (@yndajas). You might be able to reach me by email, but don't bank on it: [yndajas@gmail.com](mailto:yndajas@gmail.com). And I have a lightweight forever-in-progress [personal site](https://yndajas.github.io/simple-website).

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Projects

In lieu of a hard-to-maintain detailed projects section, below are links to a select few repositories to which I've made substantial contributions.

I don't have a well-maintained CV either, but my LinkedIn profile includes a fairly detailed history of CV-like facts, sans details on specific projects.

For a more comprehensive look at past personal/non-client work, there's a handy filter to view all of [my non-archived original ('source' or non-forked) repositories](https://github.com/yndajas?tab=repositories&q=&type=source). This filters out several hundred archived forked repositories, most of which are just study materials and exercises.

### Client work

- [Accredited Programmes UI](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-accredited-programmes-ui), Ministry of Justice - a user interface to help people in prison access accredited courses
- [Signon](https://github.com/alphagov/signon), Government Digital Service - a single sign-on provider and access and permissions manager for GOV.UK
- [Report Official Development Assistance](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-report-official-development-assistance), Department for Science, Innovation and Technology - a service for monitoring and reporting on aid-related spending

### Games

Various games are available to download or play in browser at [my itch.io profile](https://yndajas.itch.io).

- [It's Closing Time](https://github.com/yndajas/1-bit-jam-2) - a cute Godot game about getting rid of customers

I'm also working on a multiplayer game inspired by [Colourbrain](https://bigpotato.co.uk/products/colourbrain) using WebSockets and a state machine, written in TypeScript and powered by Bun, but this is in a private repository.

### Other

- [dxw's playbook](https://github.com/dxw/playbook) - a Jekyll site using Decap CMS
- [personal website](https://github.com/yndajas/simple-website) - a simple site in terms of content, but a low tech playground (useful features with minimal dependencies)
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/yndajas/dotfiles) - my dotfiles with a setup script powered by [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot?tab=readme-ov-file#full-example)
